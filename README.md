## Production

You just have to run `npm run start` to start the server.

With Nginx, a basic proxy is all that is requried.

Then, you can use `certbot` to generate SSL / HTTPS for you.

```nginx
server {
    server_name app.example.com

    # 

    location / {
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
       proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

       # replace :4646 with your app's env PORT
       proxy_pass http://localhost:4646;

       proxy_redirect off;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
       proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto "https";
   }

   location ~ /.well-known {
       allow all;
   }

   # ipv6
   listen [::]:80;

   # ipv4
   listen 80;
}
```
